This program is a die game where multiple players roll die and score points.
First player makes the moves for their turn, then continues to another player.
The player that reaches 50 points wins, or whoever has the most points after five turns of playing.

CURRENT NOTES:
- Tupled Out Rolls are working, fixed Rolls need some work
- Reroll system needs to be fixed, rerolls only happen on one die
- High scores need to be implemented
Follow directions within the program.
